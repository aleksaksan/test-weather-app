Weather Forecast Application 
**Objective:**Build a simple Vue.js application that allows users to search for locations and display current weather conditions along with a daily forecast.

Search for locations using an API (e.g.,https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search?name=Berlin&count=10&language=en&format=json).
Fetch and display daily weather forecasts and current conditions (e.g.,https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=55.7522&longitude=37.6156&hourly=temperature_2m&start_date=2024-04-02&end_date=2024-04-03).
Present the forecast in a user-friendly format (a simple list or chart).
Requirements:

Must use Vue.js.
Implement location search through the API.
Time stamps should be converted to the userâ€™s local timezone.
